<b>I am on the job market for Fall 2022.</b>

I'm a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/">CS theory group</a> at <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">CU Boulder</a>.

I did my Ph.D. in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/">Combinatorics and Optimization</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> under Joseph Cheriyan and Chris Godsil.

Before that, I got a M.S. in <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/">Math</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/">CS</a> at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a>.

As an undergrad, I majored in CS and Music at <a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/">Southwestern University</a>.
					
I have a broad interest in Algebra, Combinatorics, and Optimization. Recently I've been using algebraic techniques to solve problems in extremal combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Many of these problems feature matchings.
