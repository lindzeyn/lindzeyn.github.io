**I am on the job market for Fall 2022!**
{: .notice}

I'm a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/">CS theory group</a> at <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">CU Boulder</a>.

I did my Ph.D. in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/">Combinatorics and Optimization</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~jcheriya/">Joseph Cheriyan</a> and <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cgodsil/">Chris Godsil</a>.

Before that, I got a M.S. in <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/">Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a>.

I have a broad interest in Algebra, Combinatorics, and Optimization. Recently I've been using algebraic techniques to solve problems in extremal combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Many of these problems feature matchings.
