<b>I am on the job market for Fall 2022.</b>

<p>Currently, I'm a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/">CS theory group</a> at <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">CU Boulder</a>.</p>
		<p>I did my Ph.D. in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/">Combinatorics and Optimization</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
		<br>Before that, I got a M.S. in <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/">Math</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a>.
		<br>Back in Texas I studied Computer Science, Music, and Math at <a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/">Southwestern University</a>.</p>
					
		<p>I have a broad interest in Algebra, Combinatorics, and Optimization. Recently I've been using algebraic techniques to solve problems in extremal combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Many of these problems feature matchings. </p>
